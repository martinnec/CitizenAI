"""
Alternative script to load government services and ensure they are stored locally.

This script:
1. Creates a GovernmentServicesStore instance
2. Uses the load_services() method (which tries local first, then external)
3. Ensures the services are stored locally for future use
4. Reports on semantic search capabilities and embedding status
5. Demonstrates semantic search if embeddings are available

Usage:
    python load_services_simple.py
    
    # To enable semantic search (embeddings computed when loading from external store):
    set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
    python load_services_simple.py
