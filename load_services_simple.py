Alternative script to load government services and ensure they are stored locally.

This script:
1. Creates a GovernmentServicesStore instance
2. Uses the load_services() method (which tries local first, then external)
3. Ensures the services are stored locally for future use

Usage:
    python load_services_simple.py
